        Growing up in a small, rural, Ohio town with just his single mother, times
        were quite tough for Lebron. Through basketball, particularly through his
        basketball coach at St. Marie High, Lebron was inspired to be great. His coach,
        Keith Dambrot, helped lebron mature into the great man he'd be, both on and
        off the court. Fueled by his rough childhood, and inspired by a great man and coach,
        Lebron would soon become an unstoppable athletic force. Lebron's rough childhood,
        and committment to influencing positive change in his community, has led him to
        open the I Promise School, a public elementary school in Akron, Ohio, opened in 2018,
        supported by the LeBron James Family Foundation, and specifically aimed at at-risk children.
